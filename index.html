          <p>If you are truly an anime lover and want to watch something that makes science look fun, go for Dr. Stone, the new age science-based anime which proves entertainment can at times equal education. In a way, this show is a spin on the concept of the early man in a more futuristic wilderness setting. With art strikingly gorgeous, characters fully developed and the plot centered on using science as a weapon of human revival makes the proceedings more and more fun. Each episode provides an interesting insight into the mind of Senku, the protagonist, and watching him talk about the power of science as well as create today's gadgets from the scratch keeps the fun coming.</p>
